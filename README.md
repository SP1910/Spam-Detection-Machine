This is my first ML project, a Spam Detection Machine bulit on SVM model with a linear kernel.<br>
To find out the best model I have used Cross Validation and also tuned hyperparameters in Model_train_test file<br>
Dataset = indian_spam csv file<br>
Finally Project.py file has all the source code of this Spam Detection Machine.<br>
